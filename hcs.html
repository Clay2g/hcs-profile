				<h4>HCS Whisky Fund Overview</h4>
				<embed src="https://elasticbeanstalk-us-east-1-777190501529.s3.amazonaws.com/HCS+Documents/HCS+Whisky+Fund+Introduction.pdf" width="900px" height="1200px" />
				<!--<div class="subsection">
					<p>FCD is the leading plantation owner, developer, and producer of agarwood, OUD oil, and related products. Agarwood is a fragrant dark resinous wood used in incense, perfume, Chinese medicine, and small carvings. First-grade agarwood is one of the most expensive natural raw materials in the world.</p> 
					<p>Traditional methods of producing agarwood are unreliable, inefficient and low yield. FCD uses advanced biotechnology and farming techniques to significantly increase the success and the yield in the delicate inoculation process versus traditional methods.</p>  
					<p>This token offering seeks to raise USD4.9 million for the development of FCD Agarwood plantation involving 12,000 Agarwood trees and production of agarwood oil, fragrance, and related products. The token will be issued using a modified ERC20 protocol.</p>
					<p>Agarwood is the primary commercial and valuable products of agarwood trees.  FCD has secured the purchase of 12,000 agarwood trees (the “Biological Assets”) in Cambodia with an independent third-party supplier.</p> 
				</div>
				<h4>Agarwood Industry</h4>
				<div class="subsection">
					<p>The current agarwood global market is valued at about USD8 billion and growing rapidly from unmet and increasing demand. Being crowned as “Liquid Gold”, the same volume of Oud Oil is more expensive than fine (999) gold.  Many high-end brands like Calvin Klein, Versace or Dior have premiere fragrance lines that feature Oud Oil.  The popularity of agarwood products creates very high demand but with limited supply, unmet demand is estimated at 80%.</p> 
					<p>With high demand and extremely limited supply, agarwood is highly coveted by the fragrance, health, beauty and pharmaceutical industries forcing prices to rise in excess of 16% per annum.  High-grade agarwood chips have recorded selling price of over USD10,000 a kilogram and distilled “Oud Oil” of over USD50,000 per kilogram.</p> 
					<p>Forestry plantations have over the last decade moved from the alternative market space to become the mainstream asset class of choice for sophisticated individuals looking to diversify their investment portfolios. Agarwood plantations have become a hedge against traditional markets as annualised timberland returns are more stable and higher than commercial real estate or S&P 500 Index in recent years.</p> 
				</div>
				<h4>Digital Asset Token Offering</h4>
				<div class="subsection">
					<p>Invest in a fully managed FCD agarwood plantation with artificial inoculation, product development, and business operations with low costs in Cambodia and with integration of international sales channels and supply chain, FCD business model is expected to create a profitable and sustainable company for its long term shareholders and token holders.</p>
					<p>Section 5 of the Offer Document contains a summary of essential elements of the digital assets, AGWD tokens, in order to aid investors when considering whether to invest in such digital assets.</p>
					<p>It should be read as an introduction to the Offer Document.  Any decision to invest in the digital assets should be based on consideration of the Offer Document as a whole by the investor. Specific reference should be made to the detailed risk warnings and disclaimers in the Offer Document.</p>
