				<h4>Traditional Whisky Painpoints</h4>
				<div class="subsection">
					<ul>
						<li>High barrier to entry - Rich person's game</li>
						<li>Lack of know-how and access - Insider's game</li>
						<li>Long investment cycle</li>
						<li>Low liquidity and transparency – small network of buyers and sellers</li>						
					</ul>

				<h4>Digital Asset Token Offering</h4>
				<div class="subsection">
					<p>By participating in the HCS Whisky Fund through STO, investors may leverage the appreciation potential of Scotch whisky assets without the entry requirements and restrictions of traditional whisky investing.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Fractionalized ownership of a portfolio of casks - lower cost of entry</li>
						<li>Cask selection led by renowned industry expert and seasoned advisor</li>
						<li>Exchange traded tokenized fund units</li>
						<li>Greater administration efficiency by digital automation</li>

				<h4 id="industry">Scottish Whisky Industry</h4>
				<div class="subsection">
					<ul>
						<li>The value of Rare Whisky has grown +582% growth since 2019, and is the topmost appreciable asset class in Knight Frank’s luxury investment index (KFLII)</li>
						<li>93% of Scotch Whisky is exported and covers 79% of the spirits exported from the UK</li>
						<li>The Chinese market has vast growth potential, as the region's appetite for rare whisky increases</li>
						<li>Practically, whisky casks and bottled-whiskies can be treated as separate markets.</li>						
					</ul>
					<p>It should be noted that the whisky market is fundamentally different from conventional commodities and traditional financial markets, with little discernible correlation. In terms of price stability, this whisky cask market is more stable by nature, in comparison to the bottled whisky market. This is, in part, due to the majority of cask beings held by wealthy individuals or families (“old money”), a demographic with relatively high holding power. This also put whisky casks in the realm of alternative assets and luxury goods. Moreover, long-term demand (export) is projected to outgrow production, leading to fewer whisky casks flowing into the private market. Practically, whisky casks and bottled-whiskies can be treated as separate markets. The bottled-whisky market has significantly higher liquidity and lower barrier to entry and is more price-sensitive in comparison.</p>

					<p>Counterintuitively, the emergence counterfeit is a good problem to have. Last year, reports of 30-Year Macallan counterfeits circulating in China signified the rise in domestic demand for high-end single malt whisky. The Chinese middle-class grew increasingly interested in Scotch whisky, opting for the spirit at trendy bars and even choosing to pair it with beloved Chinese dishes. Today, Scotch Whisky can be found in many Chinese homes, and its popularity has led to the emergence of a plethora of whisky tasting courses. Given their appreciation and attitude towards Scotch Whisky, the Chinese are lifting the culture surrounding the spirit to new heights.</p>

						<p>Every “Howard Cai® Selected” Whisky is bottled in Scotland from casks carefully selected by Mr. Howard Cai from different regional distilleries. After being bottled, each cask of whisky is labelled with its distillation year, bottling year and barrel number in detail. Bottled in its natural color and non-chill filtered, “Howard Cai® Selected” Whisky all are issued in limited editions. The label design contains many elements of Chinese heritage, adding a unique charisma to each bottle of whisky while propagating the extensive and profound culture to many parts of the world.</p>
						<p>In recent years, as awareness of single-cask whiskies have gradually increased, so has its demand. One of a kind single-cask cask-strength whiskies are no longer exclusively collected by celebrities. Many institutions have approached the brand, hoping to secure their own exclusive and dedicated edition of single-cask whiskies; such establishments include Macau Sands Group, Jiu Mao Jiu, Xin Rong Ji, the Tai Hing Group (30th Anniversary Edition). Catering to corporate clients’ appetite for single-cask whisky unknowingly became a new business model for “Howard Cai® Selected”. Through various enterprise limited editions, more people have had the chance to experience the charm of single cask whisky.</p>

						<p>In his 2020 edition of the world-famous “Whisky Bible”, Jim Murray commended two of Howard Cai Selected Whiskies, the “Howard Cai Selected Braeval” (86 Points), and the “Howard Cai Selected Ben Nevis 19 Years” (94 Points). For reference, the two Howard Cai Selected bottles scored higher than Macallan’s notable original series, demonstrating the strict criteria under which the bottles are assessed and the distinction of which the bottles have achieved.</p>
